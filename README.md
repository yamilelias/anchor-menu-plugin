# Anchor Menu Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin developed only to add a minimal functionality for a landing page to add an anchor movement animation.
For this first version it doesn't have any functionality added more than adding the animation. Customization is also not provided.

The reason I created it is because I needed a light plugin that it will not make my site slower. Also, I intended to implement this
only for menus and the plugins I found where for text.

If you're interested in giving more functionality, fork the project and make a pull request, maybe we can make something bigger1
